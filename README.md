# angular-dotNET-authentication-authorization

This repository contains the backend implementation for the [Angular .NET Authentication & Authorization UI](https://github.com/manojtharindu11/angular-dotNET-authentication-authorization-UI). Both repositories work together to build a complete authentication and authorization system using Angular for the frontend and .NET for the backend.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Implement login and signup functionality with secure password storage.
- **Authorization**: Manage user roles and permissions to restrict access to certain features or pages.
- **JWT Token Management**: Issue and validate JWT tokens for stateless authentication.
- **API Endpoints**: Provide RESTful API endpoints for user authentication, authorization, and profile management.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET Core**: Backend framework for building the API.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for database access and management.
- **SQL Server**: Database management system.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For handling user authentication.
- **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: To allow the frontend (Angular) and backend (.NET) to communicate securely.
